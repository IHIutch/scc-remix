In the early 1960's, "Master Builder" Robert Moses sought to build an expressway through Lower Manhattan. The plan was thwarted by the leadership of Jane Jacobs, journalist and activist, who led a campaign to stop the destruction of a large swath of Greenwich Village and SoHo, two of New York City's most iconic neighborhoods.

In Buffalo in the early 1960's, when disciples of Moses proposed to cut a similar swath through one of the nation's most celebrated urban parks, Buffalo did not then enjoy the leadership and vision of Jacobs and the plan proceeded, bisecting Delaware Park. While we did not have Jacobs at our side then, we have her legacy to guide us now. A [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/style/the-end-of-freeways.html?searchResultPosition=2) from 2017 highlights the plight of Delaware Park as a result of the Scajaquada Expressway and leads us to examples of other forward-thinking cities which have removed the highways that have contributed to urban blight, poverty and dysfunction.

Recently, the New York Times has published another article on America's urban highways, begging the question: [NYT Can Removing Highways Fix America's Cities?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html)

We certainly think so.
