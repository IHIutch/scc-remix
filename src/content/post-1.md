Speak now or forever hold your peace comes to mind in response to the reclamation of the Scajaquada Creek Corridor. After years of trying to restore this once magnificent waterway back to its original state, groups and individuals are coming together again and inviting the public to take part in what could be one of the biggest conservation comebacks Buffalo has seen.

This 13-mile waterbody has a very significant punch to the kinship and union of Western New Yorkers to us as a society and to our natural world and beyond. It is time for amending our past mistakes which include pollution, reconfiguration and decimation of flora and fauna. Although our present is bleak, “Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper has been making progress on restoring the health of the creek over the last decade with the most visible progress seen in Forest Lawn CemeteryC. Additional work on addressing sewage pollution is underway in Cheektowaga and Buffalo, and other efforts are gaining momentum throughout the corridor to remove toxic sediment, re-establish wetlands, and restore Hoyt Lake.” It is very conceivable that working together as a whole instead of in bit size pieces, this goal is very possible and the results are monumental. Green infrastructure and beautification, waterfront access, and basic ecological health for both humans and wildlife will be supersized. “A community inspired vision, called Scjaquada Reimagined will soon be released, and through this vision we can ensure the living infrastructure of Scajaquada Creek corridor is prioritized and accurately reflects the voices of people who should benefit from a once in a generation opportunity.”
